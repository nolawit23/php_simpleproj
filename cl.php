    <h3>Clotrimazole Drug Information</h3>
<h4>Clotrimazole Overview</h4>

Clotrimazole is used to treat vaginal yeast infections. Clotrimazole reduces vaginal burning, itching, and discharge that may occur with this condition. Clotrimazole is an azole antifungal. It works by stopping the growth of yeast (fungus) that causes the infection. The vaginal product comes in 2 forms (a vaginal cream or tablet). Some products come with a skin cream to be applied to the area around the outside of the vagina. Ask your doctor before using Clotrimazole for self-treatment if this is your first vaginal infection. Clotrimazole only works for vaginal fungal infections. You may have a different type of infection (such as bacterial vaginosis) and may need a different medication. If you have fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, stomach/abdominal pain, or a bad-smelling vaginal discharge, do not use Clotrimazole. Contact your doctor immediately because these may be signs of a more serious infection.

<h4>How To Use Clotrimazole</h4>

This product is for vaginal use only. Wash your hands before and after use. Avoid contact of this product with your eyes. If it gets into your eyes, wash them immediately with plenty of water. Call your doctor if eye irritation persists. If using the vaginal cream, follow the package instructions on how to fill/use the applicator with the cream. Lie on your back with your knees toward your chest. Insert one applicator filled with cream into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go.

Follow the package instructions on how to fill the applicator with the vaginal tablet. Lie on your back with your knees toward your chest. Insert the tablet or the applicator into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go. Slowly press the plunger of the applicator to release the tablet. If you have itching/burning around the outside of the vagina (vulva), apply the skin cream to that area usually once or twice a day for no more than 7 days. If you are using a product with only the vaginal cream, you may apply a small amount of the vaginal cream to
