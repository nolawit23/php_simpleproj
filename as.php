<h3>Asasantin Retard Drug Information</h3>
<h4>Asasantin Retard Overview</h4>

Asasantin Retard (dipyridamole/asa) 200/25mg is used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had "mini-strokes" (transient ischemic attacks) or a previous stroke due to a blood clot and are at high risk for another stroke. It contains two medications: a very low dose of aspirin (25 milligrams per tablet) and dipyridamole in a slow-release form. Low-dose aspirin and dipyridamole are anti-platelet drugs that work to keep blood flowing to the brain by stopping platelets from clumping together. This helps prevent the platelets from forming blood clots, which can lodge in the brain and cause a certain type of stroke (ischemic stroke).

<h4>How To Use Asasantin Retard</h4>

Take Asasantin Retard (dipyridamole/asa) 200/25mg by mouth as directed by your doctor, with or without food, usually 1 capsule twice a day (morning and evening). Swallow the capsule whole. Do not crush or chew the capsule because this will destroy the slow release of the drug and may increase the risk of side effects. Take Asasantin Retard (dipyridamole/asa) 200/25mg with a full glass (8 ounces or 240 milliliters) of water unless your doctor directs you otherwise.
