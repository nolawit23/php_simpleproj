<h3>Propranolol Drug Information</h3>
<h4>Propranolol HCl Overview</h4>

Propranolol HCl 60mg is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, shaking (tremors), and other conditions. Propranolol HCl 60mg is used after a heart attack to improve the chance of survival. It is also used to prevent migraine headaches and chest pain (angina). Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. Preventing chest pain can help improve your ability to exercise. Propranolol HCl 60mg works by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in your body (such as epinephrine) that affect the heart and blood vessels. This effect reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and strain on the heart.

<h4>How To Use Propranolol HCl</h4>

Take Propranolol HCl 60mg by mouth, usually 2 to 4 times daily or as directed by your doctor. Take Propranolol HCl 60mg before meals (and at bedtime if taking 4 times daily). Measure the liquid medication with a medication-measuring spoon or device. Do not use a household spoon because you may not get the correct dose. Use Propranolol HCl 60mg regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same times each day. It is important to continue taking Propranolol HCl 60mg even if you feel well.
