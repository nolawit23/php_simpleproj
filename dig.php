 <h3>Digoxin Drug Information</h3>
<h4>Digoxin Overview</h4>

Digoxin 0.25mg is used to treat heart failure, usually along with other medications. It is also used to treat a certain type of irregular heartbeat (chronic atrial fibrillation). Treating heart failure may help maintain your ability to walk and exercise and may improve the strength of your heart. Treating an irregular heartbeat can decrease the risk for blood clots, an effect that may reduce your risk for a heart attack or stroke. Digoxin 0.25mg belongs to a class of medications called cardiac glycosides. It works by affecting certain minerals (sodium and potassium) inside heart cells. This reduces strain on the heart and helps it maintain a normal, steady, and strong heartbeat.

Take Digoxin 0.25mg by mouth with or without food, usually once daily or as directed by your doctor.
